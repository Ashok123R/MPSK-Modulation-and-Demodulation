# MPSK-Modulation-and-Demodulation
Following are the steps to be followed for the simulation experiment.
1. Read the image cameraman.png. You can get the image by clicking here. The image is of size
256 Ã— 256. Use suitable python package for reading the image (imageio, opencv etc).
2. Convert the pixel values to bits and map to MPSK symbols. Make sure to use same number
of bits for all the values. Plot the constellation diagram of the MPSK symbols.
3. Set an SNR value for the transmission and generate a complex Gaussian noise with enough
number of samples for the required SNR. Here Es
N0
can be considered as the SNR. Since each
value of SNR is generated by varying the noise power you can take Es = 1.
4. The received signal which is the combination of MPSK symbol and the noise samples shall
be passed through an ML decoder to do the demapping. The constellation diagram of the
received signal shall be plotted.
5. Convert the demapped symbols to bits and then to pixel values. Also find the SER and BER.
6. Reconstruct the image.
7. Iterate the above steps for SNR (in dB) values from -10 to 10 with increments of 1 and
plot the SER and BER separately. Also plot the theoretical SER and BER value for MPSK
Modulation. Compare them.
8. Iterate all the above steps for M=2,4,8.
